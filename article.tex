The Left Arm Bias in Taekwon-Do Patterns Chon-Ji to Juche

\Section{Introduction}



Patterns in International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) are defined as a
choreographed sequence of fundamental movements, which represents an attack
or defense towards a particular target area or definite action of an
attacker, against one or several imaginary opponents.

These patterns are said to be using every available attacking and blocking
tool from different directions\cite{cyclo:vol1}. It has, however, recently
been observered that a right leg bias exist\cite{rlb}.

A study of arm techniques in patterns Chon-Ji to Juche, initiated in the hope
of uncovering whether or not there is a bias to either arm, is reported here.




A \emph{pattern} is a series of predefined basic elements called fundamental
movements. The \emph{fundamental movements} are attack or defensive techniques
against a specific target area or a predetermined action of an attacker.

Combined in a pattern, the student systematically deals with several imaginary
opponents under various assumptions, using every available attacking and
blocking tool from different directions\cite{cyclo:vol1}.



% Problem Statement
%
% pp. 154-155
% given the weight/importance of fundamental movements and patterns in the encyclopedia
% with approximately 3,200 techniques and
%Patterns, therefore,
%are the technical identity of Taekwon-Do.
% The following points should be considered while performing patterns:
%
%   9. Attack and defense techniques should be equally
%      distributed among right and left hands and feet
%
% and
%
% 'using every available attacking and blocking tool from different
% directions..'
%
% and the recent discovery of the right leg bias,
%
% Is there a bias towards the right or the left arm in ITF Taekwon-Do
% patterns Chon-Ji to Juche?
%
% note that Gibb's article includes *all* the patterns


Overall, there are a total of 152 kicks. 85 kicks are with the right
leg, and 67 kicks are with the left leg. This means that 56\% of all
kicks in patterns are with the right leg, whereas 44\% are with the left
leg.


\Section{Method}

How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you
use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of
field data for an actual product? What was the extent of your work (did
you look at one application program or a hundred programs in twenty
different programming languages?) What important variables did you
control, ignore, or measure?

% Tagging can be defined as the practice of creating and
% managing labels that categorize content using simple
% keywords.

\Section{Results}

What's the answer? Specifically, most good computer architecture papers
conclude that something is so many percent faster, cheaper, smaller, or
otherwise better than something else. Put the result there, in numbers.
Avoid vague, hand-waving results such as ``very'', ``small'', or
``significant.''

If you must be vague, you are only given license to do so when you can
talk about orders-of-magnitude improvement. There is a tension here in
that you should not provide numbers that can be easily misinterpreted,
but on the other hand you don't have room for all the caveats.

\Section{Conclusions}

What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the
world (unlikely), be a significant ``win'', be a nice hack, or simply
serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (all
of the previous results are useful). Are your results general,
potentially generalizable, or specific to a particular case?
